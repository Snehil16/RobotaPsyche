# 28th Feb

1. Develop a more complex ecology
2. Bring in a predator in the ecosystem?
3. Different behaviours of different creatures 

# 1st March 

1. Started to work on my previous code
2. Changed the attributes of the classes and made a new class DNA
3. Rather than using arrays to store the creatures I am using arraylists now

# 2nd March

1. Debugging errors
2. Rather than one food source being there constantly, I decided to generate the food on the screen once the creatures have consumed the food. 
3. The food should not disappear once the creature (prey) comes near it or in contact. 
4. Attraction force- between the preys and food source

# 3rd March 
1. The speed of the creatures should be depending on their hunger level
2. The idea I was able to implement was that the size of the prey gets bigger as they eat the food. The size is inversely proportional to the speed of the prey.
3. So larger the size less the speed and vice versa. 
4. Should there be a competition between the two types of preys?

# 4th March
1. I implemented the concept of separation as there is a competiton between the two preys
2. If the size of one prey is bigger than the other prey then the bigger prey will try to consume similarly like the food. 
3. So the smalled doesnt vanish but slowly finishes as the bigger prey eats it.


# 7th March 
1. The predator should follow the prey rather than having a weird movement pattern 
2. The prey should try to run away from it and also try to move towards the food source will avoiding the predator. 
3. Add text() function to give a more understanding UI.
