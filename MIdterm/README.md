# Ecosystem (Midterm)

## Old Description 

There are a lot of preys which are the start of the food chain and are very weak. I thought from their perspective, as they are very weak and vulnerable to protect themselves they are terrified of the other creatures or animals in the food chain too. So, I thought of two organisms which are at the very bottom of the food chain and are always considered as the prey. The feeling both will have is to move away from each other in order to save themseleves. 

The red organisms are attracted to the cursor on the basis of its hunger level and it loses more lifespan compared to the blue organisms. The blue organisms attract towards a food source which appears on the screen randomly. It moves towards the source again according to its hunger level. 

## New Description (Rough Idea)

The concept in the old description will be groundwork for the new ecosystem that I will make. The are a lot of changes that I would like to do in my ecosystem. 
1. Different sizes for different creatures
2. Different level of max speed
3. On screen text to indicate which color represents which animal
4. On screen text to show hunger level or lifespan
5. Add a predator and may eat both the prey and grow bigger?
6. DNA's affect the behaviour of each creature

## Final Description 

I have a new perspective towards the ecosystem. There might be preys in the food chain that are too weak and vulnerable to defend themselves from strong predators that are higher in the food chain. In my previous ecosystem, I showed that these preys will be terrified from each other thinking that the other is stronger. However, now they move in cohesion towards the food source. As they are same types of species but different characteristics. They feed on the same source and each prey grows differently. If one prey is bigger (size) than the other prey then it will consume the prey as it consumes the food. So the prey will lose its lifespan rather than vanishing at once. This is implemented because these preys (blue and red) both take time to consume the food source rather than finishing it once.

### Characteristics of the Preys
1. Different level of max speed depending on the size. Size is inversely proportional to the speed.
2. Different lifespans, even the members of same type (red or blue) do not have the same lifespan. 
3. Different sizes for different creatures depending on how much food they consumed. 
4. Afraid of the predator and would try to run away from it. 
5. Lifespan decreases if the creature is not near the food source. 
6. If the creature collides with the wall then its speed is decreased.
