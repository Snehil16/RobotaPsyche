# Ecosystem (Midterm)

## Old Description 

There are a lot of preys which are the start of the food chain and are very weak. I thought from their perspective, as they are very weak and vulnerable to protect themselves they are terrified of the other creatures or animals in the food chain too. So, I thought of two organisms which are at the very bottom of the food chain and are always considered as the prey. The feeling both will have is to move away from each other in order to save themseleves. 

The red organisms are attracted to the cursor on the basis of its hunger level and it loses more lifespan compared to the blue organisms. The blue organisms attract towards a food source which appears on the screen randomly. It moves towards the source again according to its hunger level. 

## New Description 

The concept in the old description will be groundwork for the new ecosystem that I will make. The are a lot of changes that I would like to do in my ecosystem. 
1. Different sizes for different creatures
2. Different level of max speed
3. On screen text to indicate which color represents which animal
4. On screen text to show hunger level or lifespan
5. Add a predator and may eat both the prey and grow bigger?
6. DNA's affect the behaviour of each creature
