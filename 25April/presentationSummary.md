For my presentation, I chose the topic of "Robotic Warfare" and what effects are there if we include robots in warfare. I had a motive behind picking this topic because of all the scifi movies that I have watched had robotic warfare (Iron Man)


Robots used in warfare are remote controlled or autonomous robots which are created for various military tasks. Military tasks ranges from transport to search and rescue and attack.
