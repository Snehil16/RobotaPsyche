For my presentation, I chose the topic of "Robotic Warfare" and what effects are there if we include robots in warfare. I had a motive behind picking this topic because of all the scifi movies that I have watched had robotic warfare (Iron Man). The reason why I was so fascinated about this research isn't because it's bringing movies into real life, but rather the fact that it really got me thinking due to the fact that movies aren't really all that fantasy and as a matter of actual reality that has been turned into entertainment to take advantage of the thirst for human interest and imagination.


Robots used in warfare are remote controlled or autonomous robots which are created for various military tasks. Military tasks ranges from transport to search and rescue and attack. Although generally a science fiction topic, the employment of robots in combat is being investigated as a possible future way of combat battles. Various militaries have already created a number of military robots. Some predict that autonomous weaponry systems will fight modern warfare in the future.


There are various ethical concerns when humans life are in hands of robots. Therefore, the questions that I raised throughout my presentation were:
1- What is AI warfare in your opinion?
2- Will future wars be fought with robots?
3- Who would initiate the fights or wars?
4- What happens when robots stops working properly during a war?
5- Why do you think robots should be used in wars?
6- Whether using autonomous weapons in war would make wars worse, or make wars less bad?
7- Why is the use of robots in war unethical if soldiers are not in direct line of fire?
8- If the AI thinks projected good to be achieved by war is proportional to the ultimate destruction from the violence, it is justified. What do you think?
