We had 2 readings, Vehicles 4 and No Women Born, and 1 episode from Star Trek, Measure of a Man. 

# Vehicle 4

Vehicle 4 is the improved or the advanced version of vehicle 3. The sensors and motors now function on the maximum speed the vehicle can reach. When the sensor is activated the motors reaches a maximum speed and after that the speed will decrease again. Now, can you think of an animal that may have the same behaviour as this vehicle? What ideas did you have for other movers with different mechanism of motors and sensors? What kind of behaviour will they have?

# Measure of a Man

This episode had a lot of ethical questions. To analyse the episode we asked what are robot rights? what is the property of the fleet? Do you think Data is right? Memory that has been restored is not the original memory anymore? Why are the humans not required to replace the parts of their body with new-tech? Define sentience?

# No Women Born

“No women born,” the story plot where the most attractive woman in the world comes back from the death transformed into a robot sparks many ethical questions. So we raised the questions such as Is it ethical to make a person robot, resurrection into machinery? How would you react if you see Deirdre on TV? What gives us humanity? What constitutes a human?
How would you distinguish between a robot and a human? Through Deirdre’s story, we explored the many dimensions in the discussion of human-robot future.  In the Star Trek episode, Data’s robot right was being discussed as the central theme. The questions we raised were these what are robot rights? Do you think they are property of the fleet? Do you think memory that has been restored is not the original memory anymore? Why are the humans not required to replace the parts of their body with new-tech?
