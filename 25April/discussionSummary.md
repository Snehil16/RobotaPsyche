“No women born,” the story plot where the most attractive woman in the world comes back from the death transformed into a robot sparks many ethical questions. So we raised the questions such as Is it ethical to make a person robot, resurrection into machinery? How would you react if you see Deirdre on TV? What gives us humanity? What constitutes a human?
How would you distinguish between a robot and a human? Through Deirdre’s story, we explored the many dimensions in the discussion of human-robot future.  In the Star Trek episode, Data’s robot right was being discussed as the central theme. The questions we raised were these what are robot rights? Do you think they are property of the fleet? Do you think memory that has been restored is not the original memory anymore? Why are the humans not required to replace the parts of their body with new-tech?
