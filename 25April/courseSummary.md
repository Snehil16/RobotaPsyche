The course has been interesting since the first week. When we read "Introduction and Vehicles 1-3 in Vehicles" by Braitenberg gave me a different outlook towards vehicles. I did not think that we could categories these non-living robots as animals or insects. Although the class is mainly concerned with the ethical questions about robots, but the coding assignments were the best for me. We were given the freedom to make our own ecosystem. It was so interesting aas everyone had a different concept and a different way of implementing it. We had to develop a set of rules for simulating the real-world behavior of a creature, such as a nervous fly, swimming fish, hopping bunny, slithering snake, etc. Give the creature a personality through its behavior and not through its visual design.
